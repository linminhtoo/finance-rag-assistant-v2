We refer to these measures as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss). We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our investors to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures."

As previously disclosed in the Prospectus, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as follows:\n",
       "We did not adequately design and maintain an effective risk assessment process at a sufficient precision level to identify risks of material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the implementation of controls was not sufficient to respond to risks of material misstatement to financial reporting, including a lack of effectively designed controls over segregation of duties, particularly over the preparation and review of journal entries and account reconciliations.\n",
       "This material weakness could result in a misstatement of substantially all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\n",
       "We did not design and maintain effective information technology (\"IT\") general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored; and (iv) program development controls to ensure that new software development is tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately.\n",
       "These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements, however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness."

       "This Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as \"will,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" or \"continue\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading \"Risk Factors\" included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q and those included within our final prospectus dated March 19, 2024, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n",
       "- our expectations regarding our revenue, expenses, and other operating results;\n",
       "- our ability to acquire new customers and grow our customer base;\n",
       "- our ability to successfully retain existing customers and expand sales within our existing customer base;\n",
       "- launching new products and adding new product capabilities;\n",
       "- future investments in developing and enhancing our business;\n",
       "- our expectations regarding our ability to expand;\n",
       "- our anticipated capital expenditures and our estimates regarding our capital requirements;\n",
       "- the estimated size of our total available market (\"TAM\") opportunity;\n",
       "- investments in our selling and marketing efforts;\n",
       "- our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants;\n",
       "- our reliance on our senior management team and our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel;\n",
       "- our ability to effectively manage our growth;\n",
       "- economic and industry trends and other macroeconomic factors, such as fluctuating interest rates and rising inflation; and\n",
       "- the impact of global pandemics, health crises, political conflicts and other global financial, economic, and political events on our industry, business, and results of operations.\n",
       "We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events.\n",
       "We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on management's current beliefs and our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\n",
       "The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or investments we may make. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we, in the future,"

       "This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), which we use to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. We refer to these measures as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss). We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our investors to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures."

       "A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As previously disclosed in the Prospectus, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as follows:\n",
       "We did not adequately design and maintain an effective risk assessment process at a sufficient precision level to identify risks of material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the implementation of controls was not sufficient to respond to risks of material misstatement to financial reporting, including a lack of effectively designed controls over segregation of duties, particularly over the preparation and review of journal entries and account reconciliations.\n",
       "This material weakness could result in a misstatement of substantially all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\n",
       "We did not design and maintain effective information technology (\"IT\") general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored; and (iv) program development controls to ensure that new software development is tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately.\n",
       "These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements, however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness."

We plan to review business processes and IT processes and design and implement internal controls consistent with the principles of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") framework to address the risks of material misstatement. Such activities may include designing and implementing new business processes, enhancing information and communication processes, assessing risk, improvements to control documentation, enhancements to segregation of duties and access rights, and deployment of new IT systems and system functionalities as necessary. We also plan to establish a monitoring function over internal control over financial reporting, including internal audit, to evaluate and enhance internal controls consistent with the COSO framework and the requirements of a public company. We further plan to implement and operate an appropriate set of IT general controls covering all financially significant systems, which includes controls covering security administration, segregation of duties, computer operations, system implementations, change management, complementary user controls for hosted systems, oversight activities for significant third-party vendors and others.\n",
       "As of March 31, 2024, the remediation efforts, which have been or are in the process of being implemented, are intended to address the identified material weaknesses, and include:\n",

Although we have made enhancements to our control procedures, these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until our controls are effectively designed and operational for a sufficient period of time, and management concludes, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Accordingly, the material weaknesses are not remediated as of March 31, 2024."

       "This Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as \"will,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" or \"continue\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading \"Risk Factors\" included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q and those included within our final prospectus dated March 19, 2024, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n",

       "- our expectations regarding our revenue, expenses, and other operating results;\n",
       "- our ability to acquire new customers and grow our customer base;\n",
       "- our ability to successfully retain existing customers and expand sales within our existing customer base;\n",
       "- launching new products and adding new product capabilities;\n",
       "- future investments in developing and enhancing our business;\n",
       "- our expectations regarding our ability to expand;\n",
       "- our anticipated capital expenditures and our estimates regarding our capital requirements;\n",
       "- the estimated size of our total available market (\"TAM\") opportunity;\n",
       "- investments in our selling and marketing efforts;\n",
       "- our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants;\n",
       "- our reliance on our senior management team and our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel;\n",
       "- our ability to effectively manage our growth;\n",
       "- economic and industry trends and other macroeconomic factors, such as fluctuating interest rates and rising inflation; and\n",

The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.\n",

We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.

       "This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain financial measures that are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), which we use to supplement the performance measures in our consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP. We refer to these measures as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss). We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our investors to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures."

We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would change the fair value of our investment in marketable securities by \\$1.0 million and \\$0.9 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively."

       "This Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as \"will,\" \"shall,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"intends,\" \"target,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" or \"continue\" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading \"Risk Factors\" included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q and those included within our final prospectus dated March 19, 2024, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n",
       "- our expectations regarding our revenue, expenses, and other operating results;\n",
       "- our ability to acquire new customers and grow our customer base;\n",
       "- our ability to successfully retain existing customers and expand sales within our existing customer base;\n",

       "- future investments in developing and enhancing our business;\n",
       "- our expectations regarding our ability to expand;\n",
       "- our anticipated capital expenditures and our estimates regarding our capital requirements;\n",
       "- the estimated size of our total available market (\"TAM\") opportunity;\n",
       "- investments in our selling and marketing efforts;\n",
       "- our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants;\n",
       "- our reliance on our senior management team and our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel;\n",

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures under Internal Revenue Code Section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. The rule became effective for the Company in 2022 and resulted in the capitalization of research and development costs which was offset by a valuation allowance. The Company will amortize these costs for tax purposes over 5 years for research and development performed in the U.S., and over 15 years for research and development performed outside of the United States. The effect of the TCJA has resulted in reporting taxable income in 2023 and 2024, despite incurring a pre-tax loss.\n",

Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified in the condensed consolidated financial statements as income tax expense."

We refer to these measures as \"non-GAAP financial measures.\" These non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss). We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to assist us in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core operating results, we believe that non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and others because they allow for additional information with respect to financial measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and they may be used by our investors to help them analyze the health of our business. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures, and these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures."

We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, the continuing market acceptance of our products, and the use of cash to fund potential mergers or acquisitions. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected."

We do not believe that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies would have a material effect on our operating results."

As previously disclosed in the Prospectus, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as follows:\n",
       "We did not adequately design and maintain an effective risk assessment process at a sufficient precision level to identify risks of material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the implementation of controls was not sufficient to respond to risks of material misstatement to financial reporting, including a lack of effectively designed controls over segregation of duties, particularly over the preparation and review of journal entries and account reconciliations.\n",
       "This material weakness could result in a misstatement of substantially all of the financial statement accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\n",
       "We did not design and maintain effective information technology (\"IT\") general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of its financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that program and data changes are identified, tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to appropriate personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored; and (iv) program development controls to ensure that new software development is tested, authorized, and implemented appropriately.\n",
       "These IT deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement to our consolidated financial statements, however, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we have determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness."

We plan to review business processes and IT processes and design and implement internal controls consistent with the principles of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") framework to address the risks of material misstatement. Such activities may include designing and implementing new business processes, enhancing information and communication processes, assessing risk, improvements to control documentation, enhancements to segregation of duties and access rights, and deployment of new IT systems and system functionalities as necessary. We also plan to establish a monitoring function over internal control over financial reporting, including internal audit, to evaluate and enhance internal controls consistent with the COSO framework and the requirements of a public company. We further plan to implement and operate an appropriate set of IT general controls covering all financially significant systems, which includes controls covering security administration, segregation of duties, computer operations, system implementations, change management, complementary user controls for hosted systems, oversight activities for significant third-party vendors and others.\n",

       "- during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, formed a formal Disclosure Committee that has oversight responsibility for the accuracy and timeliness of disclosures made by us through controls and procedures and the monitoring of their integrity and effectiveness.\n",
       "We have made progress towards designing and implementing the plan to remediate the material weaknesses and will continue to review, revise, and improve the design and implementation of our internal controls as appropriate. Although we have made enhancements to our control procedures, these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until our controls are effectively designed and operational for a sufficient period of time, and management concludes, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Accordingly, the material weaknesses are not remediated as of March 31, 2024."
